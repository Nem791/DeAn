                            The main aim of conducting the IELTS listening section is to test your listening ability. It is not enough that you only
                            practice the listening test using the practice materials or from the previous tests, you must also listen to some
                            general audios like, television, radio, documentation and so on to improve your listening skills. You can also watch
                            some interesting series. Through this, you can also improve your speaking skills along with listening skills.

                                The audios played in section 3 of the listening test are always about education, for example, the student and the
                                tutor discussing a class topic or an assignment. You have to be very sure about the vocabulary about studying in a
                                university. This will help you to understand this section in a better way.

                                question while listening to the audio. If you go through the questions you will get to know which words to fill in
                                the gap that is given. You also will be able to find out whether it is a verb or a noun and will be easy to write

                                Before each situation in the question, you will be given a short introduction about whatever video is going to play.
                                For example: in the audio, they will say “now there will be a conversation between..” and other similar sentences,
                                by which you will come to know about the conversation between who is speaking in the audio. And this information
                                will not be written on the question paper, you have to identify only listening to the audio that is played. So you
                                have to be alert from start to end when the audio is played. By listening to the important points you will know what
                                is the rest of the audio about.

                                Do not lose your attention on the audio from beginning to end. You have to keep in mind that the audio is played
                                only once and is not repeated. If you have missed any of the questions then do not worry, focus on the upcoming
                                questions so that you don’t lose further marks. You can review the left out questions at the end of filling the
                                other answers. If you keep on thinking about the question which is left out, you will also miss out the further
                                questions as well as the audio recording and will not be able to attempt any of the questions. In this section you
                                have to do multitasking, that is read, write and listen accordingly.

                                There are few times students tend to write the answer as soon as they listen to the audio. Sometimes the answer they
                                have written may not be correct, and the correct answer may be in the next sentence. Thus, while writing the answer
                                you need to keep in mind that you have to listen to the complete sentence and then write the answer.

                                mistakes that you have committed while taking the IELTS listening test. The mistakes may be like spelling mistakes,
                                grammar or word forms. You have to keep in mind that it is an English language test and even the smallest mistake
                                also counts and you may also lose the marks for the same. Only the correctly written answers will fetch you good

                                After listening to the audio, the test takers will have 10 minutes to transfer their answers to their answer sheet
                                that is given. Make sure that you transfer the answers correctly. And do not mix up the answer with other answers.
                                The numbering should be proper, if the numbering is accurate then it will be easy to write the correct answers and
                                will be less confusing.

                                It is said that you should not write any wrong answers, but make sure you do not leave any blank spaces also. So, if
                                you do not know the answer write something related in the blank spaces, if you have listened to the audio carefully
                                you will have an idea of what to write for the particular question while reading the same. Read the question, again
                                and again, to make a guess what could be the answer.
